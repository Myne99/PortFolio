I made this donut as my first 3D project using Blender. I started with basic shapes and slowly added more details to make it look realistic. I learned how to add colors, textures, and lighting to give the donut a shiny chocolate look. One of the hardest parts was getting the chocolate to look smooth and glossy, but I figured it out by adjusting how the light reflects off it. This project helped me understand the basics of 3D design and how to make something look real.

## Progress
