This 2D platformer game was developed in C++ using OpenGL as part of a Game Engine Development course. The game features a cheerful, bouncing character who jumps between platforms, collects coins, and aims for a high score in a bright, sky-themed world.

I focused on core gameplay mechanics like movement, collision detection, and real-time score tracking. One of the biggest challenges was getting the jump physics to feel natural â€” I spent a lot of time adjusting values and testing different approaches until the character's movement felt smooth and responsive.

The project also gave me experience working with OpenGL rendering, basic UI elements, and restart functionality. It was a fun way to explore how platformers are built from the ground up, and it really helped strengthen my understanding of game loop logic and input handling.
