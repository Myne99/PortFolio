This 2D arcade-style flying game, Wing It, was built in C++ using OpenGL. Players control a yellow stunt plane soaring through the sky, dodging other aircraft and the occasional heat-seeking missile. The game combines simple controls with fast-paced action to create a quick, high-stakes experience.

The game world features scrolling clouds, enemy planes, and randomly triggered missile attacks that keep players on edge. Getting the missile to track the player in a believable but fair way was one of the more complex challenges â€” I had to experiment with vector math and movement smoothing to get the targeting behavior right.

 This project helped me develop stronger skills in OpenGL rendering, object behavior programming, and basic AI-like movement. It was also a fun way to learn how to make a game feel dynamic and unpredictable using relatively simple mechanics.
