This 3D snow globe was created in Blender as a fun, festive promotional concept. It features bold 3D text, snow-covered trees, and a glass dome set against a bright holiday-themed background. I used lighting and transparency techniques to make the glass look realistic and create a retail display feel. One of the most challenging parts was getting the snow animation to feel natural â€” I experimented with different particle settings to get the right motion and density. This project helped me improve my skills in scene composition, lighting, and working with animated elements in Blender.
