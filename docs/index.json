I started with basic shapes and slowly added more details to make it look realistic. I learned how to add colors, textures, and lighting to give the donut a shiny chocolate look. One of the hardest parts was getting the chocolate to look smooth and glossy, but I figured it out by adjusting how the light reflects off it. This project helped me understand the basics of 3D design and how to make something look real.\nProgress # Back to Portfolio\r","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/PortFolio/portfolio/donut/","section":"Portfolio","summary":"","title":"My First Donuts","type":"portfolio"},{"content":" This 2D platformer game was developed in C++ using OpenGL as part of a Game Engine Development course. The game features a cheerful, bouncing character who jumps between platforms, collects coins, and aims for a high score in a bright, sky-themed world.\nI focused on core gameplay mechanics like movement, collision detection, and real-time score tracking. One of the biggest challenges was getting the jump physics to feel natural — I spent a lot of time adjusting values and testing different approaches until the character\u0026rsquo;s movement felt smooth and responsive.\nThe project also gave me experience working with OpenGL rendering, basic UI elements, and restart functionality. It was a fun way to explore how platformers are built from the ground up, and it really helped strengthen my understanding of game loop logic and input handling.\nBack to Portfolio\r","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/PortFolio/portfolio/gedassigment/","section":"Portfolio","summary":"","title":"OpenGL Platformer Game","type":"portfolio"},{"content":" My Projects # Here\u0026rsquo;s a collection of projects I\u0026rsquo;ve worked on during my academic journey and personal development.\nMy First Donuts # My first 3D project using Blender.

Players control a yellow stunt plane soaring through the sky, dodging other aircraft and the occasional heat-seeking missile. The game combines simple controls with fast-paced action to create a quick, high-stakes experience.\nThe game world features scrolling clouds, enemy planes, and randomly triggered missile attacks that keep players on edge. Getting the missile to track the player in a believable but fair way was one of the more complex challenges — I had to experiment with vector math and movement smoothing to get the targeting behavior right.\nThis project helped me develop stronger skills in OpenGL rendering, object behavior programming, and basic AI-like movement. It was also a fun way to learn how to make a game feel dynamic and unpredictable using relatively simple mechanics.\nBack to Portfolio\r","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/PortFolio/portfolio/groupproject/","section":"Portfolio","summary":"","title":"Wing It By No Game Plan","type":"portfolio"},{"content":" This 3D snow globe was created in Blender as a fun, festive promotional concept. It features bold 3D text, snow-covered trees, and a glass dome set against a bright holiday-themed background. I used lighting and transparency techniques to make the glass look realistic and create a retail display feel. One of the most challenging parts was getting the snow animation to feel natural — I experimented with different particle settings to get the right motion and density.
